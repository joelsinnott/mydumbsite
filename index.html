          <p>
            I remember the day I purchased my first iPad. We were still early in
            mobile development days, so the App Store was mainly filled with
            noise, but FiftyThree had launched Paper, and it changed how I used
            my iPad. Paper had completely redefined the process of ideation,
            sketching, and digital communication, while raising the bar for what
            a quality mobile app should be. It was one of the first mobile apps
            I remember connecting with. I’d doodle around all day in it, whether
            it was for school assignments, or just to create cute love letters
            to send to Mikael Cho. Today, Paper (now by WeTransfer) continues to
            allow us to express ourselves creatively. They just released a
            fluid, physical interface, making it easier to work with images. You
            can now cut out, combine, clip, and arrange images together on one
            screen, while allowing you to also natively pull in beautiful
            imagery, powered by the Unsplash community’s library of
            high-resolution photos. Here are a few highlighted features from the
            new release: Adding an Unsplash image to Paper WeTransfer has made
            it really easy to work with high-quality images. With the Unsplash
            integration, you’ll be able to search the library of over 900k+
            beautiful photos to add to Paper. And as with all Unsplash
            integrations, you will find the photographer’s name under each
            photo. I remember the day I purchased my first iPad. We were still
